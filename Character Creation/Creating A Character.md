# Creating a Character
Your character is your gateway into the world your GM is creating. Before diving into the character creation process, you should invent an idea for a character you want to play. Perhaps your GM has created a High Fantasy game setting, and you wish to play a fire-slinging wizard, or they have created a Far-future Sci-Fi setting, and you want to play a gunslinging smuggler. After receiving the available options from your GM you should, using your idea for a character:
    1. Choose a species
    2. Choose a background
    3. Choose a class

While creating this character, use the provided character sheet to fill in the information chosen. This sheet also provides a base for gameplay.

## 1. Choosing a species
Within the world of you GM, there will be one of more playable species to choose from. Perhaps the world is a multi-racial fantasy world, with elves, dwarves, halflings and gnomes, or a universe spanning multiple planets with a variety of alien species. A species may also have a subspecies, such as wood elves or high elves for the elven species. Choose a species, and a subspecies if applicable, and then note the features and traits of your choice on your character sheet.
