# Creating a Character
Your character is your gateway into the world your GM is creating. Before diving into the character creation process, you should invent an idea for a character you want to play. Perhaps your GM has created a High Fantasy game setting, and you wish to play a fire-slinging wizard, or they have created a Far-future Sci-Fi setting, and you want to play a gunslinging smuggler. After receiving the available options from your GM you should, using your idea for a character:
    1. Choose a species
    2. Choose a background
    3. Choose a class

While creating this character, use the provided character sheet to fill in the information chosen. This sheet also provides a base for gameplay.

## 1. Choosing a species
Within the world of you GM, there will be one of more playable species to choose from. Perhaps the world is a multi-racial fantasy world, with elves, dwarves, halflings and gnomes, or a universe spanning multiple planets with a variety of alien species. A species may also have a subspecies, such as wood elves or high elves for the elven species. Choose a species, and a subspecies if applicable, and then note the features and traits of your choice on your character sheet.

## 2. Choosing a background
With your characters species selected, you should now select the background best befitting the character you have created. Has you character spent their life an urchin living on the streets, or a member of a noble house. Have they served in the military, or are they a bounty hunter, living off money from the contracts they collect. Choose a background, and add the relevant items and bonuses to your character

## 3. Choosing a class
Now that your character's past has been established, you should now choose their class. This represents the path you character will go on whithin their adventuring career. Their class has special talents they use, and will evolve as they gain more experience in their life. Note down you characters class, and the features of that class for that classes first level

### 4. Starting at a higher level
While the typical game starts at 1st level, some campaigns may start at a higher level, or you may be creating a new character in the middle of a campaign. In this case, you should first create a level 1 character, and then immediately level up that character until you get to the desired level.

## 4. Calculate Ability Scores and Skills
The ability scores of your character are a representation of the physical and mental statistics of your character. Your GM has determined which ability scores are relevant to their game, as well as the skills attached to them. You should read through what these skills represent, then assign them a score according to your characters natural abilities.

To assign a score to each ability, you should first determine how many points you have to available to distribute. This is 5 x *Number of Ability Scores*. You can then spend these points to assign a score to a ability according to the table below. Do this before adding any bonus from your species/class/background.

| Score | Cost |
| ----- | ---- |
| -3    | -5   |
| -2    | -2   |
| -1    | 0    |
|  0    | 2    |
|  1    | 4    |
|  2    | 7    |
|  3    | 11   |
|  4    | 18   |

After your ability scores have been assigned, you can then calculate your skills. Each skills is attached to
an ability, and can you skill score is calulcated as 10 + the associated ablility score. This number is than modified by how trained you are in this skill. Your species, background, or class may give you a training in a certain skill, which may evolve over the lifetime of your character. There are 4 levels of training; trained, experienced, specialist, masterful. Each level of training increases that skills score by 2.

## 5. Calculating other scores.
**Armour Rating:** Your armour rating is calculated according to whichever armour you are wearing. Your armour will have a base value, and may be increased by a corresponding skill. Without armour, your armour rating is 10 + your dexterity score.

**Initiative:** Intiative represents your reflexes in dangerous situations. When determining your initiative, you compare your initiative score to all other characters within the initiative. Characters with the same initiative may spend effort points to perform their actions first, or may negotiate with others to determine order.

**Speed:** The speed of a character represents how far that character may move in the timespan of one round. Each species gives a speed in for each character, which my be modified by other special features or abilities.

## 6. Choosing equipment.
Your character's species, background, and profession determines which how much currency you character has, and which equipment your character has access to purchase.
