# Creating a Character
Your character is your gateway into the world your GM is creating. Before diving into the character creation process, you should invent an idea for a character you want to play. Perhaps your GM has created a High Fantasy game setting, and you wish to play a fire-slinging wizard, or they have created a Far-future Sci-Fi setting, and you want to play a gunslinging smuggler. After receiving the available options from your GM you should, using your idea for a character:
    1. Choose a species
    2. Choose a background
    3. Choose a class

While creating this character, use the provided character sheet to fill in the information chosen. This sheet also provides a base for gameplay.

## 1. Choosing a species
Within the world of you GM, there will be one of more playable species to choose from. Perhaps the world is a multi-racial fantasy world, with elves, dwarves, halflings and gnomes, or a universe spanning multiple planets with a variety of alien species. A species may also have a subspecies, such as wood elves or high elves for the elven species. Choose a species, and a subspecies if applicable, and then note the features and traits of your choice on your character sheet.

## 2. Choosing a background
With your characters species selected, you should now select the background best befitting the character you have created. Has you character spent their life an urchin living on the streets, or a member of a noble house. Have they served in the military, or are they a bounty hunter, living off money from the contracts they collect. Choose a background, and add the relevant items and bonuses to your character

## 3. Choosing a class
