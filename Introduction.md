# Introduction
This tabletop roleplaying game system has two goals it aims to achieve:
    1. To provide a modular game building experience, allowing game masters to better tell the stories they wish to, and
    2. To provide a streamlined and thoughtful gaming experience for the player, cutting out much of the frustration from randomness that comes with this genre of games.

Games using this system consist of a Game Master (GM), and their players. The role of the Game Master is to facilitate the players within the world they have created, and is driven by the imagination of the players and the GM. Each player typically controls a Character within the game, though which they interact with the world.

## How To Play
A typical game using this sytem runs in a cycle between the GM and and players. The GM describes the situation to the players, environment and its inhabitants, and the players then describe the action of their character within this environment. The DM listens to the players and then resolves the actions of those characters, describing the result to the players.

Most mundane actions, like walking, writing, speaking, etc. are part of life for these character, and as such may resolve automatically. Other more difficult tasks, such as sneaking up behind a character, breaking down a door, deciphering ancient runes, or hacking a computer, require additional rulings to resolve. Depending on the difficulty, the DM sets a Difficulty Rating (DR) on the action the character is undertaking, and then determines a skill which the character must use to complete such an action. The player then compares this number to the same skill on their character sheet. The action is successful if the value of the characters skill meets of exceeds the DR set by the GM.

#### Example Difficulty Ratings
| Difficulty      | Rating |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Very Easy       | DR 8   |
| Easy            | DR 10  |
| Medium          | DR 15  |
| Hard            | DR 19  |
| Very Hard       | DR 23  |
| Near Impossible | DR 28  |

### Effort Points
In addition to using a character's skills and abilities to complete tasks, a player may expend effort points to aid their character. A character has a number of effort points they may use between rest times without suffering penalties, and may expend as many points as they wish per action. Each effort point expended in performing an action decreases the Difficulty Rating of that action by 1. This may be represented in game by a character exerting physical or mental strength above and beyond the typical, having a stroke of genius, etc. GMs are encouraged to describe these events on top of the completion of the task.

Players who wish to expend effort beyond their limit cause their characters to suffer **exhaustion**.

### Advantage/Disadvantage
If a character acts with advantage, each effort point expended by the player decreases the Difficulty Rating of the action by 2 instead of 1. Conversly, if a character acts with disadvantage, a player must expend 2 effort points to decrease the Difficulty Rating of the action by 1.

Characters may gain advantage or disadvantage through game rules, or at the discretion of the GM.

## Forming your world
In the spirit of the modularity of this system, each option may by included/excluded from your game, including character options, character skills and abilities, weapons, monsters, etc. Before starting a game with your players, decided on the elements of this system you wish to include, and present these to your players. To additionally tailor the experience to your world, it is encouraged, but not necessary, that you create your own rules for your own games, and include them for your players to use.
