# Introduction
This tabletop roleplaying game system has two goals it aims to achieve:
    1. To provide a modular game building experience, allowing game masters to better tell the stories they wish to, and
    2. To provide a streamlined and thoughtful gaming experience for the player, cutting out much of the frustration from randomness that comes with this genre of games.

Games using this system consist of a Game Master (GM), and their players. The role of the Game Master is to facilitate the players within the world they have created, and is driven by the imagination of the players and the GM. Each player typically controls a Character within the game, though which they interact with the world.
