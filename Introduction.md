# Introduction
This tabletop roleplaying game system has two goals it aims to achieve:
    1. To provide a modular game building experience, allowing game masters to better tell the stories they wish to, and
    2. To provide a streamlined and thoughtful gaming experience for the player, cutting out much of the frustration from randomness that comes with this genre of games.

Games using this system consist of a Game Master (GM), and their players. The role of the Game Master is to facilitate the players within the world they have created, and is driven by the imagination of the players and the GM. Each player typically controls a Character within the game, though which they interact with the world.

## How To Play
A typical game using this sytem runs in a cycle between the GM and and players. The GM describes the situation to the players, environment and its inhabitants, and the players then describe the action of their character within this environment. The DM listens to the players and then resolves the actions of those characters, describing the result to the players.

Most mundane actions, like walking, writing, speaking, etc. are part of life for these character, and as such may resolve automatically. Other more difficult tasks, such as sneaking up behind a character, breaking down a door, deciphering ancient runes, or hacking a computer, require additional rulings to resolve. Depending on the difficulty, the DM sets a Difficulty Rating (DR) on the action the character is undertaking, and then determines a skill which the character must use to complete such an action. The player then compares this number to the same skill on their character sheet. The action is successful if the value of the characters skill meets of exceeds the DR set by the GM.

### Example Difficulty Ratings

| --------------- | ------ |
| Very Easy       | DR 8   |

| Hard            | DR 19  |
